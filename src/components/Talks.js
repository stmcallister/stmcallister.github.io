            Testing is vital to any software project. Automated tests help improve 
            confidence in code changes as you increase project velocity. Finding the right 
            tools and libraries can be an arduous process. And, in most languages, adding 
            testing means adding a pile of new dependencies to the project. But, have you 
            ever tried the tools built right into the language? One of the beauty's of the 
            Go programming language is built with productivity in mind. The creators of the 
            language have included many tools that make developers productive--including a 
            robust testing framework. Come see how easy it is to get started with Go's testing 
            library and see many of the features that will keep you using it in all your projects.

          <p>
            Traditionally, when developers see large arrays of data their "go to" 
            tool for parsing and searching has been the for loop. But JavaScript 
            provides a more declarative approach that can help you find what you're 
            looking for in fewer lines of code that is cleaner, easier to read, and 
            maintain. Come see how the map(), reduce(), and filter() functions can 
            help you!

            The traditional 'box' layout model was designed to layout documents, not 
            apps. Many hours have been lost endlessly tinkering with the positioning 
            of HTML elements, but the joy at achieving perfect alignment is short-lived. 
            Everything looks great until the page is loaded on a mobile device, and it 
            looks like you threw things on a page from across the room. There's a better 
            way!
          </p>
          <p> 
            In this talk I will teach you about the flexbox layout model and CSS grid. 
            We will cover these concepts at a high level, discuss why they are a better 
            approach, and I will show you how to use them effectively. Used in tandem, 
            these widely supported techniques can make your pages responsive, more accessible, 
            and easier to build.

            Functions built in to the Array object, like Map, Filter, and Reduce make 
            our code more declarative and readable. But, how do these functions perform 
            against for and forEach loops? Come watch these methodologies go head-to-head 
            as we see just how fast each of these functions compare to similar loops!

            Picking up a new framework with a new design paradigm can be daunting. You 
            hear familiar names being tossed around (Components, Libraries, Objects), but 
            they're being used in new and mysterious ways. In this talk we'll cover what 
            some of these pieces are, how they're different, how to use them properly, and, 
            most importantly, how they fit together as pieces of a greater whole. Come see 
            why the Angular way of doing things is awesome (and easy).

          <p>
            With Google Apps Script, Google has provided a way for developers to add functional 
            to Google Suite apps. While using Google's in-browser editor to write sample Google 
            Add-ons can be handy for extremely basic scripts, it gets clunky fast when developers 
            want to do something like version control their code or have more than one person working 
            on a script. With the help of a couple open source projects, developers can now build Add-ons 
            on locally, on their own machines, with the tools they're most comfortable with.

          <p>
            For years, the best tool for dealing with arrays was the for loop. But for loops get verbose 
            and can easily cause bugs. Lucky for us Java 8 introduced the Streams API. Using Streams can 
            shift your coding style from imperative to declarativeâ€”resulting in cleaner code that is easier 
            to write, read, and maintain. Come see how using Streams can take your Java to the next level.
