This concept of configuring infrastructure as code is gaining traction \n            throughout the industry for a variety of reasons. It's fast, consistent, reduces errors, \n            self-documentation, and did I mention it's fast? Tools such as Terraform from HashiCorp \n            have emerged as one of the leading ways to declaratively configure technology stacks.\n\n            In this talk you'll gain an understanding of the benefits of Infrastructure as Code in \n            general, and of using Terraform specifically. You'll be introduced to how Terraform works, \n            what the code looks like, and how to get started.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>      \n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Built-In Testing in Go is More Than Just Passable</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            Go\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n            Testing\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Testing is vital to any software project. Automated tests help improve \n            confidence in code changes as you increase project velocity. Finding the right \n            tools and libraries can be an arduous process. And, in most languages, adding \n            testing means adding a pile of new dependencies to the project. But, have you \n            ever tried the tools built right into the language? One of the beauty's of the \n            Go programming language is built with productivity in mind. The creators of the \n            language have included many tools that make developers productive--including a \n            robust testing framework. Come see how easy it is to get started with Go's testing \n            library and see many of the features that will keep you using it in all your projects.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>      \n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Why Loop in JavaScript When You Can Map, Reduce or Filter?</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            JavaScript\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n            Functional Intro\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Traditionally, when developers see large arrays of data their \"go to\" \n            tool for parsing and searching has been the for loop. But JavaScript \n            provides a more declarative approach that can help you find what you're \n            looking for in fewer lines of code that is cleaner, easier to read, and \n            maintain. Come see how the map(), reduce(), and filter() functions can \n            help you!\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>      \n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Flexbox + CSS Grid = Awesome!</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            CSS\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The traditional 'box' layout model was designed to layout documents, not \n            apps. Many hours have been lost endlessly tinkering with the positioning \n            of HTML elements, but the joy at achieving perfect alignment is short-lived. \n            Everything looks great until the page is loaded on a mobile device, and it \n            looks like you threw things on a page from across the room.

In this talk we'll cover what \n            some of these pieces are, how they're different, how to use them properly, and, \n            most importantly, how they fit together as pieces of a greater whole.

With the help of a couple open source projects, developers can now build Add-ons \n            on locally, on their own machines, with the tools they're most comfortable with.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Why Loop in Java When You Can Stream?</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            Java\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n            Streams\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For years, the best tool for dealing with arrays was the for loop. But for loops get verbose \n            and can easily cause bugs. Lucky for us Java 8 introduced the Streams API. Using Streams can \n            shift your coding style from imperative to declarative—resulting in cleaner code that is easier \n            to write, read, and maintain.
