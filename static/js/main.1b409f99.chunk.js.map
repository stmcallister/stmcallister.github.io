Since that time I've developed all kinds of websites and applications, in a variety\n          of technologies. Along the way, I also discovered I loved to write, and ultimately teach.\n          Now I am helping others learn about a wide range of development technologies.

This concept of configuring infrastructure as code is gaining traction \n            throughout the industry for a variety of reasons. It's fast, consistent, reduces errors, \n            self-documentation, and did I mention it's fast? Tools such as Terraform from HashiCorp \n            have emerged as one of the leading ways to declaratively configure technology stacks.\n\n            In this talk you'll gain an understanding of the benefits of Infrastructure as Code in \n            general, and of using Terraform specifically. You'll be introduced to how Terraform works, \n            what the code looks like, and how to get started.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>            \n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Modules, Loops and More: How to Scale with Terraform</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            Infrastructure as Code\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n            DevOps\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Terraform has become vital to your team's workflow for managing your infrastructure. However, as \n            your infrastructure has grown your code has become more complex, needlessly messy, and harder to \n            manage. In this talk we explore ways to simplify your infrastructure code even while you add more \n            resources to your infrastructure. We'll dive into advanced features in Terraform such as modules, \n            workspaces, for_loops, and data sources to build reusable, scalable infrastructure. By the end of \n            this talk, you will have a solid understanding of how to use Terraform to scale infrastructure in \n            a reliable and efficient way.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>      \n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>What the Heck Is HTTP?</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            Network\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n            Development\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            You see it on the front of URLs.

So you're likely using it in everything \n            you build. But, what the heck is HTTP, really? \n\n            In this talk, we'll dive into the mechanics of HTTP starting from requests & responses, diving into \n            nouns & verbs, and going deep into the mechanics of how authentication works over the protocol.

Automated tests help improve \n            confidence in code changes as you increase project velocity. Finding the right \n            tools and libraries can be an arduous process. And, in most languages, adding \n            testing means adding a pile of new dependencies to the project. But, have you \n            ever tried the tools built right into the language? One of the beauty's of the \n            Go programming language is built with productivity in mind. The creators of the \n            language have included many tools that make developers productive--including a \n            robust testing framework. Come see how easy it is to get started with Go's testing \n            library and see many of the features that will keep you using it in all your projects.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>      \n     \n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Flexbox + CSS Grid = Awesome!</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            CSS\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            The traditional 'box' layout model was designed to layout documents, not \n            apps.

Used in tandem, \n            these widely supported techniques can make your pages responsive, more accessible, \n            and easier to build.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Why Loop in JavaScript When You Can Map, Reduce or Filter?</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            JavaScript\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n            Functional Intro\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Traditionally, when developers see large arrays of data their \"go to\" \n            tool for parsing and searching has been the for loop. But JavaScript \n            provides a more declarative approach that can help you find what you're \n            looking for in fewer lines of code that is cleaner, easier to read, and \n            maintain. Come see how the map(), reduce(), and filter() functions can \n            help you!\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>      \n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Performance Cage Match: (Map, Filter and Reduce) vs For Loop</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            JavaScript\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n            Performance\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Functions built in to the Array object, like Map, Filter, and Reduce make \n            our code more declarative and readable. But, how do these functions perform \n            against for and forEach loops? Come watch these methodologies go head-to-head \n            as we see just how fast each of these functions compare to similar loops!\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Connecting the Dots: How Angular Components Work Together</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            Angular\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Picking up a new framework with a new design paradigm can be daunting. You \n            hear familiar names being tossed around (Components, Libraries, Objects), but \n            they're being used in new and mysterious ways. In this talk we'll cover what \n            some of these pieces are, how they're different, how to use them properly, and, \n            most importantly, how they fit together as pieces of a greater whole. Come see \n            why the Angular way of doing things is awesome (and easy).\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Develop Add-ons for Google Apps AND Stay Sane</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            Google Apps Script\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n            Google Suite Add-ons\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            With Google Apps Script, Google has provided a way for developers to add functional \n            to Google Suite apps. While using Google's in-browser editor to write sample Google \n            Add-ons can be handy for extremely basic scripts, it gets clunky fast when developers \n            want to do something like version control their code or have more than one person working \n            on a script. With the help of a couple open source projects, developers can now build Add-ons \n            on locally, on their own machines, with the tools they're most comfortable with.\n          </p>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n\n      <div className=\"row item\">\n        <div className=\"twelve columns\">\n          <h3>Why Loop in Java When You Can Stream?</h3>\n          <p className=\"info\">\n            Java\n            <span>&bull;</span>\n            Streams\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            For years, the best tool for dealing with arrays was the for loop. But for loops get verbose \n            and can easily cause bugs. Lucky for us Java 8 introduced the Streams API. Using Streams can \n            shift your coding style from imperative to declarative—resulting in cleaner code that is easier \n            to write, read, and maintain.
